This is wrapped in a try statement, because we don't want this
to get stuck running (e.g. in case of program crash)
and using "finally" to clean up the GPIO pins (i.e. setting 
them back to a neutral state, instead of any electricity flowing to them 
in a low or high state, unknowingly)

which is best practices, and your program will actually 
give an error code if you don't clean up the GPIO pins

example error if run without clean up on second run:
	RuntimeWarning: This channel is already in use, continuing anyway.  
	Use GPIO.setwarnings(False) to disable warnings.
