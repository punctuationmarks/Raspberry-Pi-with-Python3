# Things needed

- Rasperry Pi

- can ssh into the Rasperry Pi
- when you add anything to the Rasperry Pi like pins, camera, sensors, ect
  - you'll need to change the config files and possibly reboot
    `$ sudo raspi-config`

# SSH into RPi

- On Rpi,

```
$ ifconfig
```

This will give you the wlan0 (on wifi with RPi 4), which has
inet ip info

```
$ sudo raspi-config

```

- On config, select SSH and turn it on

- On computer you want to use to SSH into the RPi

```bash
# should look something like this
$ ssh pi@192.168.1.92
$ ssh pi@192.168.1.98

# which then this will print
